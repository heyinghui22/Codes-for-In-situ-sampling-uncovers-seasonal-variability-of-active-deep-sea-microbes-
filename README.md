# In situ sampling uncovers seasonal variability in community structure and metabolism of active deep-sea microbes

## Overview

This repository contains the code used in the study titled "In situ sampling uncovers seasonal variability in community structure and metabolism of active deep-sea microbes."
This study investigates the seasonal dynamics of deep-sea microbial communities and their metabolic activities using in situ metagenomes and transcriptomes.

## Content

-**Figures 2**
Contains input datasets and code for calculating and visualizing Principal Coordinate Analysis (pCoA) and stacked bar charts of microbial community composition. Community composition was analyzed using QIIME software. Detailed calculation steps and parameters are described in the Methods section of the paper.


-**Figures 4 and 5**
Contains input datasets and code for:
o	Calculating and visualizing the distribution of marker genes across different taxonomic groups (bubble plots).
o	Extracting and visualizing the seasonal expression levels (winter vs. summer) of marker genes, including metabolic genes and conserved proteins (box plots).
Calculations were performed using CoverM software. Detailed methods and parameters are provided in the Methods section.


-**Figure 6**
Contains input datasets and code for microbial co-occurrence network analysis and network visualization.
Detailed calculations and parameters are described in the Methods section of the paper.
